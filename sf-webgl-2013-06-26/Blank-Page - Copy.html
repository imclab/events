	<p>Jaanga is the home of a variety of 3D visualization apps.</p>

	<p>This repository is dedicated to <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Tukey' target='_blank'>John Tukey</a> 
		for his vision in describing exploratory data analysis.</p>

	<p>See also the web site at <a href='http://jaanga.com' target='_blank'>jaanga</a>.</p>

	<p>Everything here is <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open_source_software' target='_blank'>free and open source software</a>.</p>

	<p>All the source code for the apps is hosted and accessible via <a href='http://github.com' target='_blank'>GitHub</a> in public repositories.</p>

	<p>The goal is that all the apps here could be useful to non-technical people and entry-level programmers.

	<p>The intention is that all the apps run via an API and that 'builder tools are available to get going.</p>

	<p>To be continued and expanded...</p>
